Projects or ideas for class
A few hours today, I learnt about Git Hub, this is completely new way for me to work on my projects and use it as a way to practice my skills. I think this is an exciting week as everything is brand new. Still not sure what to make of everything. I have mixed emotions all around but at the same time I am excited about the possibilities. Trying to figure out how the pull change occurs too.
